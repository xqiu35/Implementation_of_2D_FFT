# Implementation_of_2D_FFT
Implementation of 2D FFT using POSIX Threads (C++) <br/>

This implementation belongs to Xiaofei Qiu, Computer engineering student in Georgia Tech<br/>

This implementation assume the input image has same height and width <br/>

The code is present in pthreadFFT2d.c <br/>

Tower.txt is defual input image data (256 x 256) <br/>

Defult using 16 CPUs to do FFT <br/>
